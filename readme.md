# 2D Terrain Generator

This is a automaton that is used to create procedual 2D worlds and maps. I plan on using this tool in future projects in order
to make small games. 

This tool was made using my framework which can be viewed over at [this](https://github.com/NM711/ECAutomata) repository.


It has a clean and user friendly API, this way other people can find ways to incorporate the terrain generator in their own projects,
you can view the header files in order to gain a better understanding of what each function does.
